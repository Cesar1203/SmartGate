Please refactor the SmartCater project to align with the real GateGroup “Pick & Pack” process and the official Smart Execution track from HackMTY 2025.

🧠 Core Mission

Build a smart execution system that helps GateGroup’s employees work faster, make fewer mistakes, and react efficiently to last-minute flight or weather changes — fully aligned with real Pick & Pack operations.

🧩 Real Process Integration

Implement SmartCater as a digital tool that assists during the Preparation + Assembly phases of Pick & Pack:

Guides employees through the correct “specification” (product list per flight).

Detects errors before sealing drawers or trolleys.

Automates decisions about bottles and food reassignment.

Adjusts quantities dynamically based on flight reliability and expiration.

✈️ Functional Modules

Alcohol Bottle Handling

Photo upload or camera capture of a bottle.

Vision AI (simulated or real) estimates fill %.

Apply contract-based rules (JSON editable per airline):

>70% → reuse, 40–70% → combine, <40% → discard.

Log action + confidence level + airline ID.

Real-Time Error Detection

Upload trolley image.

Compare vs “golden layout” template.

Simulate visual feedback: missing/wrong/extra item.

No slowdown for employees; instant feedback on screen.

Employee Efficiency

Dashboard tracking time per trolley, errors, and accuracy.

Step-by-step checklist for each spec.

Simple gamification (progress bar, performance score).

Flight Reliability + Weather Module

Integrate or simulate weather API.

Compute probability of on-time departure.

Suggest load adjustments (e.g., “reduce 30% fresh items if < 60% reliability”).

Automatic Reassignment

If a flight is delayed/cancelled → reassign only to flights of the same airline within 6 hours.

If no same-airline match → mark food as “Expiring Soon.”

Log action visibly in dashboard (🟢 reassigned / 🔴 expired).

⚙️ Architecture

Frontend: React + Tailwind (clean GateGroup orange/gray/white theme).

Backend: FastAPI or Express.

DB: PostgreSQL / SQLite for mock.

AI simulation: YOLOv8 or mock function for fill %, SSIM for image comparison.

Demo mode: offline simulation (no API keys required).

🎯 Demo Mode

Preload 3 airlines (AMX, LH, AA) each with their own rules/specs.

Random weather and bottle data for demonstration.

Show dashboards with flights, reliability %, and employee metrics.

✅ Success Criteria

Follows GateGroup’s Pick & Pack logic and airline segregation rule.

Reduces manual decision time.

Provides clear, instant feedback to workers.

Demonstrates speed, accuracy, sustainability, and employee usability.
